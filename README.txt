# Stock Market Management Program
- Written in Java using Intellij Community Edition
- Terminal interface program
- Implemented Singleton & Factory design pattern

## NOT WORKING
- printAllStocks() is not working properly. It is only making it part way through the method calls
(just found 11/18)

### Concerning Main:
- When using public static void for methods that return results in the form of System.out.println();
- Many, or most were originally created with the intention of returning a boolean to show success or not
- Not sure which is better technically.
- Currently those boolean returns would go to waste, so I removed them - for now.

### Will implement sorting methods
- sort by sharePrice
- sort by creationDate

### Need to create licensing (MIT)
