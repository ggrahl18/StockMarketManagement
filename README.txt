# Notes on coding

# NOT WORKING
- findStock() is not working properly: IndexOutOfBoundsException
- this error applies to many methods. Many methods use this method to implement
further functionality (just found 11/17)

### Concerning Main:
- When using public static void for methods that return results in the form of System.out.println();
- Many, or most were originally created with the intention of returning a boolean to show success or not
- Not sure which is better technically.
- Currently those boolean returns would go to waste, so I removed them - for now.

### Will implement sorting methods
- sort by sharePrice
- sort by creationDate

### Need to create .gitignore & licensing (MIT)
- just don't know where it goes... lol
- README may be in correct spot
